# Cat Comfort Game - The Ultimate Useless Sh!t Challenge Entry

## üõÅ Project Overview

Welcome to the **Cat Comfort Game**, a whimsical and utterly "useless" temperature control simulation designed to bring a smile to your face (or perhaps a confused frown). Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to meticulously adjust the water temperature in a virtual cat's shower to keep it within a "comfortable" range. Sounds simple? Think again! With unpredictable temperature shifts, control reversals, and bubbly obstructions, this game is a delightful exercise in digital feline pampering, perfectly embodying the spirit of the "Useless Sh!t Challenge" for the Reddit Devvit platform.

## üèÜ Hackathon Submission Details

### Useless Sh!t Challenge

This game is our proud entry for the "Useless Sh!t Challenge." We've embraced the spirit of bringing a "wacky, weird, and silly idea" to Reddit. The concept of meticulously managing a virtual cat's shower temperature is inherently quirky and non-essential, yet it provides an engaging and unexpectedly challenging gameplay loop. It aims to entertain through its sheer absurdity and the unpredictable obstacles it presents within the Reddit ecosystem.

### Built with Bolt.new

The Cat Comfort Game is built primarily with [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/), leveraging its integrated development environment for a seamless full-stack experience. The core functionality, UI components, and backend logic are all developed within the Bolt.new ecosystem.

**Important**: For your official hackathon submission, please ensure the publicly deployed version of the Project interface includes the required "Built on Bolt" badge as per the hackathon guidelines
