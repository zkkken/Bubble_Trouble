## Getting Started

This template is made specifically to work with **Bolt.new**.
Click the button below to open this template directly in Bolt:

<a href="https://bolt.new/github.com/reddit/devvit-bolt-starter-experimental"><img src="docs-img/open-in-bolt-2x.png" heigh="36px" width="199px" alt="Open in Bolt"></a>

As soon as the project is checked out you will get the following errors.
**This is expected**!

```
‚ùå  Authentication: Please run `npm run login` to authenticate with Reddit
‚ùå  App initialization: Please run `npm run devvit:init` to setup your app remotely
‚ùå  Playtest subreddit: Please update YOUR_SUBREDDIT_NAME in the dev:devvit script in package.json
```

### Step 1: Login

In bolt terminal, run

```
npm run login
```

This will authenticate with Reddit. You will be prompted to follow a link and paste an authentication code.
Paste that authentication code in your **terminal window** in Bolt, then press `<Enter>`.

### Step 2: App Initialization

In bolt terminal, run

```
npm run devvit:init
```

This will get your app set up with Devvit. You will be prompted to follow a link and paste an authentication code. Paste that authentication code in your **terminal window** in Bolt, then press `<Enter>`.

### Step 3: Playtest subreddit

For this step, you will need to go to Reddit and create an empty subreddit for you to test your app.

You can do this by following going to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) and clicking the **"Create a Community"** button in the left-side navigation. Once you create your community, paste the name of the subreddit (for example if you community is reddit.com/r/my_test_subreddit, you will paste `my_test_subreddit`) into the `package.json` file, replacing the string `YOUR_SUBREDDIT_NAME`.

After that, if you run `npm run dev` again, all checks should pass and you should be able to test your application on Reddit.

### Step 4: Testing your app

Once the initial configuration is done, you can test your application by navigating to your test subreddit, clicking the three dots icon on the top-right and creating a new post. The command will be called `[Bolt Cat Comfort Game] New Post`. Once you create a new post you can go back and forth with Bolt by prompting your way to making your app and testing it on Reddit.

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### Deploy Updated Version to Reddit

After making changes to your game, you need to upload the updated version to Reddit:

```bash
# Build and deploy the latest version
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
1. Build the client-side code
2. Upload the updated app to Reddit/Devvit
3. Make your changes live on Reddit

### Alternative Deployment Commands

```bash
# Build client only (without deploying)
npm run build:client

# Deploy without building (if already built)
devvit upload --copy-paste

# Check deployment status
devvit logs
```

### üîÑ Update Workflow

1. **Make changes** to your game in the `/src/client` directory
2. **Test locally** using `npm run dev:vite` (runs on http://localhost:7474)
3. **Deploy to Reddit** using `npm run deploy`
4. **Test on Reddit** by creating a new post in your test subreddit
5. **Repeat** as needed

### üì± Testing Your Updates

After deploying:

1. Go to your test subreddit on Reddit
2. Click the three dots (‚ãØ) in the top-right corner
3. Select **"[Bolt Cat Comfort Game] New Post"**
4. Create the post to test your updated game
5. The new version should now be live!

### üêõ Troubleshooting Deployment

If deployment fails:

```bash
# Check if you're logged in
devvit whoami

# Re-authenticate if needed
npm run login

# Try deploying again
npm run deploy
```

### üéÆ Game Features

Your Cat Comfort Game includes:
- **Temperature Control**: Use +/- buttons to adjust temperature
- **Comfort Management**: Keep the cat happy by maintaining optimal temperature
- **Interference Events**: Handle control reversals, temperature shocks, and bubble obstructions
- **Multi-Round Challenges**: Progress through increasingly difficult rounds
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time indicators and animations

Now vibe code away!

### Known limitations

- **Only test on your subreddit:** Your app's backend requests will not work on Bolt's preview window. You need to continue to test your app running in your subreddit, where your backend code will work.

- **Use Reddit's backend:** Devvit provides a free of charge scalable backend. Bolt will be able to help you use Reddit's Redis database for key-value storage. You are not going to be able to use other tools such as Supabase for your backend.

- **This is experimental:** While the Devvit team is working to make it as easy as possible to use Bolt for authoring Reddit apps, this is all still in an experimental phase.
